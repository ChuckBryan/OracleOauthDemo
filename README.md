# Oracle OAuth Demo

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow using Oracle PL/SQL. It shows how to make authenticated API calls to OAuth endpoints directly from an Oracle database, which can be useful for system-to-system integrations.

## Key Features

- Implementation of OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow in PL/SQL
- Direct API calls to OAuth endpoints from Oracle database
- JSON response parsing and token handling
- Example of using UTL_HTTP for making HTTP requests

## Important Security Notice

⚠️ **This is a demonstration project only!**

- The credentials and tokens used in this project are for demonstration purposes only
- In a production environment, never store sensitive credentials (client IDs, secrets, tokens) directly in code
- Use secure credential vaults, Oracle Wallet, or other appropriate security measures for storing sensitive information
- The code contains simplified error handling and security measures for clarity - production implementations should include robust security controls

## Technical Implementation

The project includes:

- PL/SQL function for obtaining OAuth tokens
- HTTP request handling using UTL_HTTP
- JSON response parsing
- Example of making authenticated API calls

## Prerequisites

- Oracle Database instance
- Network access to OAuth endpoints
- Required Oracle privileges for UTL_HTTP and network access

## Setup and Configuration

1. Configure the OAuth client credentials
2. Update the PL/SQL function with your endpoint details
3. Ensure proper database access privileges are set

## Usage Example

The main functionality is demonstrated in the oauth_request function, which:

1. Constructs the OAuth token request
2. Makes the HTTP call to the token endpoint
3. Parses the JSON response
4. Returns the access token for subsequent API calls

## Production Considerations

When implementing this in a production environment:

1. Use secure credential storage
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Add logging and monitoring
4. Consider token caching and refresh strategies
5. Implement proper security headers and SSL verification
6. Add rate limiting and retry logic
7. Follow your organization's security policies
